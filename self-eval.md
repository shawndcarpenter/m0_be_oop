# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
```I felt a little frustrated, and ended up needing to take a break partway through. When I came back, I attemped to find some workarounds. It was satisfying to see the code run and the error messages disappear, and I was surprised when I managed to get a times loop to work for the celebrate_birthday method. That being said, I felt that there was more I could have done to get the "eat" method working as I wanted it to. I wanted to be able to increase the argument stored in the times_eaten parameter every time I would run the code. I tried doing this with a times loop as I had done in the Hobbit exercise, but could not seem to get it to work in the same way. Either my knowledge of Ruby is still a bit limited, or there was something very obvious that I was missing.```
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
```I have been staying focused fairly easily throughout my workflow. Once I get into it, I get invested and want to find a solution. That being said, I still have to remind myself to take breaks for food, water, stretching etc., especially on this past exercise```
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
``` My big takeaway is that there is a lot that OOP can do/be used for. Just from searching through Ruby Doc, I can see I have a lot to learn. I'd like to come back to this exercise to apply my future knowledge of Ruby. Right now, I feel very limited, as even when I look something up, there are a ton of other steps I am missing. I feel that this will all come with practice and more knowledge of the language.```
